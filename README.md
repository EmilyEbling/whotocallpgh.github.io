A list of resources for the community of Pittsburgh.

To add a new resource you need to navigate to the ResourceData.js file. From there you can add a new resource "object" after the resource that is currently listed last. You must add a comma after the previous resource before adding your own (if lost, follow the format in the rest of the document). You can copy and paste the following at the end of the list and replace the bolded values with the values you want to include. Each value is optional, so if, for example, a resource does not have a website this is not something you'd have to include.

{<br>
    "name": "**Name of Organization**",<br> 
    "phone_link": "tel:**Phone Number**", <br> 
    "formatted_phone": "**PhoneNumber**", <br> 
    "website": "**Link To Website**", <br> 
    "description": "**Description**" <br>
    "tags": ["**Tag1**", "**Tag2**", ....] <br>
}
