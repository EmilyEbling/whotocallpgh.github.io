To add a new resource you can copy and paste the following and replace the values in "<>" with the values you want to include. Each value is optional, so if, for example, a resource does not have a website this is not something you'd have to include.

{
    "name": "<Name of Organization>",
    "phone_link": "tel:<Phone Number>",
    "formated_phone": "<Phone Number formated for readability>",
    "website": "<Link to Website>",
    "description": "<Description of resource>"
}
