A list of resources for the community of Pittsburgh. This list is not a complete/comprehensive list. One way to make police obsolete is to stop calling them. There are plenty of other more competent and compassionate services out there.

To add a new resource you can copy and paste the following and replace the bolded values with the values you want to include. Each value is optional, so if, for example, a resource does not have a website this is not something you'd have to include.

{<br>
    "name": "**Name of Organization**",<br> 
    "phone_link": "tel:**Phone Number**", <br> 
    "formatted_phone": "**PhoneNumber**", <br> 
    "website": "**Link To Website**", <br> 
    "description": "**Description**" <br>
    "tags": ["**Tag1**", "**Tag2**", ....] <br>
}
